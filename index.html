  <h1>Welcome to the Wizarding World of Nick Wright... and Harry Potter!</h1>

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is Nicholas Wright and I am currently a sophomore at UW-Madison! As a biology student, I am hoping to attend medical school. Some of my hobbies include spending time with friends, watching movies, hiking, and reading!<p>
    <p>I am originally from Eagan, Minnesota. Back home, my family has two dogs and two cats - one of which is named after Bucky Badger! I have three brothers, including a twin brother. Interestingly enough, all of my brothers and I have or are attending UW-Madison! In fact, my older brother is in LIS351 with m.</p>

  <h2>Why did I choose Harry Potter?</h2>
    <p>Harry Potter follows the story of a lightning-scarred boy as he faces the trifles of not only growing up, but also having to deal with a destiny out of his hands. This story is a bildungsroman, or coming-of-age story, and I grew up right alongside Harry! Thus, I definitely relate to this character in a multitude of ways. Besides Harry, himself, the different characters in this story have each taught me so much, especially his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.<p>
    <p>Stemming from my love of movies and books, I am thoroughly obsessed with the magical world of <a href="https://www.jkrowling.com/about/" target="_blank">J.K. Rowling</a>'s Harry Potter! I even brought the entire book series and a wand with me to school. Overall, this series has changed my life drastically, and I do not know who I would be today without it.</p>
