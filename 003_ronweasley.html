  <h1>Ron Weasley</h1>

  <h2>1. Who is he?</h2>
    <p>Ronald Bilius Weasley is the second youngest child in a large, pureblood wizard family. This means that the Weasleys blood is not mixed with nonmagical blood. Nonetheless, Ron's family is extremely poor, resulting in his five older brothers and one younger sister all having less-than-ideal materials. Regardless, Ron is extremely loyal, brave, and emotional. Like the rest of his family, he is in Gryffindor house at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which is where him and Harry become best friends.</p>
 
 <h2>2. What does he look like?</h2>
    <p>Ron, like the rest of his family, has bright, red hair. He wears hand-me-down robes due to his family's poverty, which is sometimes ridiculed by other students, such as Draco Malfoy. Ron has a lot of freckles and has a tall, strong build.</p>

  <h2>3. What did I learn from him?</h2>
    <p>From Ron, I learned two things. First, I learned that there are different types of intelligence. Although Ron is not academically gifted, he aids his friends in different and creative ways. This showed me that although I might not be the smartest person, I still have value. In addition, Ron taught me to be brave in the face of adversity. Ron is a true Gryffindor, standing up and protecting his friends even in the face of danger. Thus, Ron showed me what true bravery is.</p>

  <h2>4. What is my favorite quote of his?</h2>
    <p>"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!" - J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<p>
    <p>Essentially, this quote is demonstrative of the sheer bravery Ron shows in most situations (except when spiders are around). I love this quote so much because Ron fully believes that Sirius is attempting to kill Harry, and without thinking throws himself in between the situation. Therefore, this quote always stands out to me because it reaffirms the things that Ron has taught me.</p>
