  <h1>Harry Potter</h1>

  <h2>1. Who is he?</h2>
    <p>Harry James Potter is an orphaned child who is taken in by his bitter aunt and uncle. His late parents, James Potter and Lily Evans, were murdered when Harry was very young. That same night, the dark wizard who killed them, Lord Voldemort, was also supposedly vanquished by Harry, himself, in some way. This leaves Harry with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead and a famousness completely unbeknownst to him until he discovers he is a wizard on his eleventh birthday. Sometimes called "The Boy Who Lived," Harry is brave, resourceful, independent, determined, and resilient. He is in Gryffindor house at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>

  <h2>2. What does he look like?</h2>
    <p>Harry has very untidy, black hair just like his father and bright, green eyes like his mother. He is skinny and average height for his age. Additionally, Harry wears round glasses and has a lighted-shaped scar on his forehead.</p>

  <h2>3. What did I learn from him?</h2>
    <p>From Harry, I learned the power of friendship and love. Throughout the series, Harry tries to do many things alone, yet ultimately needs his friends and mentors to assist him. Through this, Harry learns how helpful friendships can be and the power they can hold. This is culminated in the fact that it was his mother's love that saved him. Overall, Harry's journey teaches a plethora of lessons that are applicable in numerous parts of my life.</p>

  <h2>4. What is my favorite quote of his?</h2>
    <p>"Working hard is important. But there's something that matters even more. Believing in yourself. Think of it this way: Every great wizard in history has started out as nothing more than we are now. Students. If they can do it, why not us?" - J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<p>
    <p> This is my favorite quote from Harry, himself, because it typifies the leadership he displays throughout the series. Harry is the main character of the story and acts as a leader to many of his friends. This requires a lot of reason and can be difficult, so I love how this quote portrays Harry!</p>
