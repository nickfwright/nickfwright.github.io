  <h1>Rubeus Hagrid</h1>

  <h2>1. Who is he?</h2>
    <p>Hagrid is the gamekeeper and Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He briefly taught Care of Magical Creatures. Hagrid is incredibly kind, loving, and loyal. He was the one who personally delivered Harry to his aunt and uncle following the death of his parents. He also was the one to tell Harry he is a wizard! Hagrid was wrongly expelled from Hogwarts, but was in Gryffindor House, just like Harry, Ron, and Hermione.</p>

  <h2>2. What does he look like?</h2>
    <p>Hagrid is described as being incredibly large, about twice as tall as regular man and a lot wider. This is due to him being a half-giant. Hagrid has a dark, thick beard and a heavy accent.</p>

  <h2>3. What did I learn from him?</h2>
    <p>From Hagrid, I learned to never judge a book by its cover. Hagrid may appear to be an oaf, but he helps out a countless amount of times and acts as a mentor to Harry and his friends. Additionally, he taught me the power of loyalty, as he remains incredibly loyal to both Albus Dumbledore and Harry. </p>

  <h2>4. What is my favorite quote of his?</h2>
    <p>"I am what I am, an' I'm not ashamed. 'Never be ashamed,' my ol' dad used ter say, 'there's some who'll hold it against you, but they're not worth botherin' with.'" - J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<p>
    <p>This quote stands out to me because it reaffirms the notion that it is ok to be different. Giants are discriminated against in the Harry Potter universe, yet Hagrid shows that he has no shame about his lineage. Thus, Hagrid acts as an example of how it is ok to stand out and do your own thing.</p>
